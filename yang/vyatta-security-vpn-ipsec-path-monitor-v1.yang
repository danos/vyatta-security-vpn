					state.

					If the compliance state is 'Compliant' or 'Marginally compliant' then
					the source-interface is eligible to establish a IPsec tunnel. If the compliance state is
					'Non-compliant' then the source-interface will not be used.

					If multiple monitor/policy pairs are specified with policy operator OR (default) then at least
					one must remain 'Compliant' or 'Marginally compliant' in order for the source-interface

					With multiple monitor/policy pairs and the policy operator AND they must all remain 'Compliant'
